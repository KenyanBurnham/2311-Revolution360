# 2311-Revolution360
This is a group project from English 2311 created in Spring 2019. 

### Prompt
The assignment was to solve a complex communication problem based on a rhetorical situation assigned to us.

### Rhetorical Situation
We are a fictional company "Alternative Lifestyles" and we have developed a marketing campaign for "Revolution360", a fictional wind energy company.
Our goal is to connect Revolution360 with a public audience. Although Revolution360's customer base is primarily large corporations, Revolution360 knows that these public companies are beholden and motivated by the actions of the public. By advertising to the public, Revolution360 can widen their customer base.
